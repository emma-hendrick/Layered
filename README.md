# Overview

With this project, my goal is to learn dart and flutter and to be able to work with the microphone. 
I hope to eventually use this to make a musical recording app that will let you record multiple 
layers of audio and play them back all at once.

# Development Environment

This was programmed using Android Studio, Dart, and Flutter. 
I used the Record library within Dart and Flutter as well in order to get data from the microphone.

# Future Work

* Add the ability to playback recorded audio
* Add some kind of visual metronome so that it is easier to stay in time
* Add the ability to record multiple layers of audio and delete recordings individually
